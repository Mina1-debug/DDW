  <h2>The most important thing to check before buying a Chromebook.</h2>
  <p>When it comes to upgrades, Chrome OS and Android couldn't be more different.</p>

<p>Since Chrome OS can't be customized by device-makers in the way that Android can,
 y'see, Google's able to control Chromebook updates completely on its own — 
 and that means pipin' hot software can roll out to all current 
 devices within days of its release, regardless of who made each laptop
 or where it was purchased. (And, uh, yeah: Suffice it to say, 
 the same can't exactly be said for Android.)</p>

<p>That's a valuable assurance to have, especially when you're spending 
hundreds of dollars on a computer you'd ideally like to use for a while. 
But as with many things in life, Chromebooks do have built-in expiration 
dates — points at which they'll no longer receive operating system updates and 
thus won't be advisable to use. And no matter what kind of deal you think you're 
getting on a Chromebook, the ultimate price you're paying is really all relative 
to that one variable and how long it allows the laptop to remain viable.</p>

 <h2>What this device can do</h2>
<p>We've talked about how on Android, in order to figure out a phone's true value, 
you have to think about the amount of time the device will receive OS and security 
updates and then do a little math to calculate its annual cost of ownership for 
advisable use — since once a phone is no longer receiving said updates, 
it's no longer advisable to use for anyone who prioritizes an optimal 
level of privacy, security, and performance. And you, as the intelligent, 
fresh-smelling, forward-facing mammal that you are, clearly know the importance of those factors.</p>

<p>Well, guess what? The same exact principle applies to Chromebooks — 
maybe even more so, given how often software updates arrive on the Chrome OS 
front (every two to three weeks for minor fixes and every six weeks for more significant revisions — whew!).
 And just like with Android, it's up to you to perform those calculations, think about a device's lifespan,
 and determine whether it's actually a smart purchase before you plunk down your hard-earned shekels.</p>

 <h2>Google Chromebook</h2>
 
<p>[Get fresh tips and insight in your inbox every Friday with JR's Android 
Intelligence newsletter. Exclusive extras await!]
The good news: None of that's difficult to do. Not even remotely.
 The main problem is just that the companies making Chromebooks don't 
 want you to think about this sort of stuff — for reasons that aren't 
 hard to figure out — and consequently, they don't make any of this information 
 (or even just the idea that there's a need for any of this information to exist in the first place) 
 easily discoverable. That's why the vast majority of Chromebook 
 shoppers are woefully ignorant in this area.</p>

<p>But now, you don't have to be. Polish up your person-face, 
perform a few gentle stretches for good measure, and prepare to be enlightened.</p>
